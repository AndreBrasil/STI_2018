# Infrastrutuctures

Tables are easy to insert: 

| Table example | Another Column |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Content here  | Here           |
| And also here | -              |

Equations are also possible with just a bit of LaTeX knowledge (or an online converter):

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

And this includes all kinds of symbols and expressions.

$$
\alpha  \beta  \gamma \rho \sigma \delta \epsilon\times \otimes \oplus \cup \cap

\int \oint \sum \prod 

< > \subset \supset \subseteq \supseteq
$$



Test.
